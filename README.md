# HSSS-Jobticket


## Description
I was tasked with analyzing the presented code for any changes that could be made towards organizing the code within CSS in a more manageable way. This project was also tasked with adjusting any HTML code to better optimize for SEO. Such as adding alt files for anyone looking at this page that would not be able to see the images provided as well as adjusting links to work properly.

## Installation

## Usage
This page can now be utilized and added on to for future purposes in a much more manageable and easy to understand way now that the CSS style sheet is set up to accurately reflect the HTML code. It has also been better optimized for anyone with an impairment that would make it difficult to view the images on the page.
